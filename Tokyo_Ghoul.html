				Tokyo Ghoul is a Japanese Animation based on the mythos of vampires, while giving it a very grusome twist. Due to some genetic accident in ancient Tokyo, humans began to eat other humans regularly. This sprouted the term ghouls, this problem was easily avoidable, until these "ghouls" developed genetic weapons called "Kagunes"(Kah-Goon-Ays) which the used to fight of humans attempting to exterminate them. A task force name the CCG in present day Tokyo was established, and using ghouls whom were killed kagunes against other ghouls in order to exterminate them for good. This story centers around Ken Kaneki, a boy who suffered a freak accident, and got his organs tranfered with that of a ghouls, in turn making him become one. It has a beautiful action-packed story that offers much to think about.

				<h3>#2)This is a very heavy scene based around the idea of accepting the things that you believe, that hold you back. Ken accepts the fact that he will have to become a ghoul, and that he is going to have to feast, which makes him stronger than ever</h3>

				<h3>#1) border-right: 1px solid #bbb;This is the final, and incredibly emotional scene of Tokyo Ghoul: Root A(this is Tokyo Ghoul, season 2). In this scene Ken Kaneki, now a full ghoul and a fugative carries his friend who despite all that Ken had done, still accepted him as a human and his friend, and didn't treat him like a monster. This a powerful scene, even if you haven't seen the series and still has the effort to send chills down the spine of whomever watches it.</h3>
